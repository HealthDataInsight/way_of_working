## Introduction

This framework will describe a consistent, high-quality approach to Software Engineering at HDI.

It is an opinionated approach intending to support rapid development, across numerous projects, by a fungible workforce who can swap between assignments with the minimum friction.

It builds on the [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net) methodology and is intended to be compatible with the [NHS Digital Software Engineering Quality Framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework) and other frameworks like [the GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital).

The most significant difference here is that we will be opinionated and make technological and process choices. Of course, users are encouraged to discuss and submit Pull Requests (PRs) if they want changes to the choices made, but by making those choices, we can automate many tedious background tasks that are currently manual.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. This RubyGem was created using `bundle gem --exe way_of_working`.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
