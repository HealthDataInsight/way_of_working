# Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Web Analytics Solution

## Context and Problem Statement

When we are in the position to use a hosted web analytics solution, we should use one, but which one should we use?

## Considered Options

<!--alex ignore simple -->
* [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com) The privacy-first Google Analytics alternative.
* [Cabin](https://withcabin.com) is a privacy-first, carbon conscious web analytics solution.
* [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) gives you the tools, free of charge, to understand the customer journey and improve marketing ROI.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Cabin", because:
* it is a cookie free solution, that does not track or gather metrics on visitors,
* it offers good value for money,
* it is hosted sustainably.
