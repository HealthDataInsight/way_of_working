# Test for insensitive and inconsiderate writing

## Context and Problem Statement

Given that checking insensitive and inconsiderate writing can be automated, should we test for it?

## Considered Options

* [alex](https://alexjs.com) helps you find gender favouring, polarising, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal phrasing.
* Manually reviewing documentation.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "alex", because
* it gives us an automated way of checking for insensitive and inconsiderate writing.

### Consequences

* Good, because it raises awareness of inclusive communication within teams. As the project README says, "An error from alex can be an invitation to learn more".
