# Pull Request guidlines and template

## Context and Problem Statement

The structure of a Pull Request (PR) can take many forms, making it difficult to understand at a glance the what, why and how of a PR. Which form should we choose?

## Considered Options

* Formless – No conventions for PR format and structure
* [What? Why? How? Testing? Screenshots (optional) Anything Else?](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/)
* [GitHub pull request template](https://axolo.co/blog/p/part-3-github-pull-request-template) examples
* [How to Write a Proper Description for a Pull Request](https://maddevs.io/blog/how-to-make-a-proper-description-for-a-pull-request/)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

Although not a template format, we should also include GitHub's communication guidlines in [How to write the perfect pull request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/).

## More Information

Whichever format is chosen, we should create an initialiser to add the GitHub [PR template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) to a project.
